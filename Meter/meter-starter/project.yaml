  # These endpoint(s) should be non-pruned archive nodes
  # We recommend providing more than one endpoint for improved reliability, performance, and uptime
  # Public nodes may be rate limited, which can affect indexing speed
  # When developing your project we suggest getting a private API key
  # We suggest providing an array of endpoints for increased speed and reliability
