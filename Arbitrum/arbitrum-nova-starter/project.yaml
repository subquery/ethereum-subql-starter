  # This endpoint must be a public non-pruned archive node
  # We recommend providing more than Nova endpoint for improved reliability, performance, and uptime
  # Public nodes may be rate limited, which can affect indexing speed
  # When developing your project we suggest getting a private API key
  # You can get them from OnFinality for free https://app.onfinality.io
  # https://documentation.onfinality.io/support/the-enhanced-api-service
  endpoint: ["https://nova.arbitrum.io/rpc"]
  # Recommended to provide the HTTP endpoint of a full chain dictionary to speed up processing
  # dictionary: "https://gx.api.subquery.network/sq/subquery/arbitrum-nova-dictionary" - we don't have one for Nova
